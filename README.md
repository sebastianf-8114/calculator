<p>While this code is included in my GitHub portfolio, I want to clarify that it <b>should not be utilized for college assignments due to plagiarism concerns</b>. I invested a considerable amount of time and energy into the development and design of this project, and I am proud of my efforts. All I ask is that you refrain from claiming my work as your own.</p>
